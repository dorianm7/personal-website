  I added a Venmo button so those that come to my site will be able to donate money to me.
    This would help me in giving me money so I can be able to live.
  I added a share sidebar where users are able to share my website through Facebook, Linkedin, Twitter,
    email and are able to print the page or share from many other options. This would help in giving
    me exposure and allowing people who enojoyed my website to share it.

  The inclusion of these allows me to view the amount of site visits and shares in a dashboard
    through the addthis website.
