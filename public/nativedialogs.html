<!-- Part 1 -->
<!-- Use at least one arrow function -->
<!-- There are timing issues with the even loop in a browser. Solution is ugly
        Watch video about event loop -->

<!-- create 3 buttons with textual values of Alert, Confirm, Prompt, Safer Prompt -->
<!-- use addEventListener to bind click events to the buttons and show a built-in alert  -->
<!-- confirm and prompt dialog on the window object -->

<!-- Use template strings to make this easier -->
    <!-- if confirm, echo value back webpage. Setting contents of an <output> to 
        "The value return by the confirm method is : (the value)" -->
    <!-- if not confirm, set contents of output to "User didn't enter anything" -->

<!-- In prompt example explore 
        use of unsafe collection of data 
        use of tagged template string to purify user inputs (to help guard against XSS)  -->
    <!-- Use DOMPurify to sanitize user inputs (Can directly link to that file on CDN or install locally) -->
