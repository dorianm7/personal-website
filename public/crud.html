<!-- Part 3 -->
<!-- Rather than saving to a database, we are going to save to a JS array -->
<!-- Array can be stored in localStorage for persistence between page loads 
        Dont save that way until you get it working completely -->
<!-- Use JS modules to keep code separated. Can make as many module as you want
        Primary module will be blog.js 
    
        Use the idea of custom dialogs from Part 2, but can extend the feature or use
            in page markup to make editing easier -->
<!-- Tips -->
    <!-- Forms have lots of useful methods and HTML markup can replace JS code -->
    <!-- Destructuring features of ES6 can tighten code ?????? -->
    <!-- Storing data or burying event handlers within HTML tags isnt necessarily a bad thing -->
    <!-- Sometimes good idea to put something on the window object -->
    <!-- Mock with simple arrays and perform each step one at a time.
            Add localStorage at the end -->
    <!-- Last assignment will have us implement this in our site with/without Firebase as backend store
        Can move on and implement such features early -->


<!-- Going to store info about blog posts (that will eventually link to a full page with the blog post)
        Post title
        Post date
        Post summary -->

<!-- Prepopulate the data store with a set array as the example video shows -->

<!-- Have an "Add button" to add a record -->
<!-- Have an "Delete button" to Delete a record -->
<!-- Have an "Edit button" to edit a record -->
